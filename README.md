Introduction and Getting Started
PowerShell is a vast product, especially when you take into account how it's used in other products such as Lync Server, Exchange, and the Windows Operating System. It can be a little daunting to those new with PowerShell - there is a vast array of deeply technical discussions of all of PowerShell's many aspects, quirks and peculiarities  and all. So start at the beginning, and learn the basics, either on you own, or possibly with the aid of a great training class. Then work with it and return to find more. And when you can, how about adding to the body of knowledge referenced here.

Getting The PowerShell Product
You get PowerShell, either fully loaded as a part of Window 7/Server 2008 R2 or later, as an add-on (eg Server 2008 RTM that enabled you to load PowerShell Version 1) or as an OS Patch.

Windows Management Framework 3.0  Jump Jump - Windows Management Framework 3.0 makes some updated management functionality available to be installed on Windows 7 SP1, Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 & Windows Server 2008 SP2. Windows Management Framework 3.0 contains Windows PowerShell 3.0, WMI & WinRM. 

Windows PowerShell Version 2.0 Jump Jump  - Windows PowerShell Version 2 is installed with Windows 7 and Server 2008 R2 (although with the server core installations, it's not installed by default). For all other versions of Windows (on which PowerShel is supported), you need to download the appropriate package and install it. The download includes Windows PowerShell Version 2 and WinRM 2.0.

PowerShell 2.0 SDK Jump Jump - The Windows PowerShell 2.0 SDK provides the reference assemblies needed to write cmdlets, providers, and hosting applications, and it provides C# sample code that can be used as the starting point when you begin writing code.

 Jump  **I changed the title from a brand-based (Survival Guide) title to a task=based title to observe the effect on page views and discoverability. This particular experiment resulted in significant reduction in page views. So I changed it back. Because that's the kind of thing you can do on the wiki :-)

Just a recommendation: don't use URL shorteners when you link from wikis. Those links are one step more fragile (since they depend on a third server) and there have been reports that some of them (bit.ly?) are blocked in China.

I'd like to add to Joel's comment - Some corporations block URL shorteners as well, as they can be used to bypass filtering.

We seem to have three introductory guides for PowerShell - an Owners Manual, a Users Guide and a Getting Started Guide. Why is that?

We could include a voting system for the links?

Nice linklist! There is nothing to criticize.

Have you considered using a Microsoft Tag to link directly to this page. It could be very useful for conferences, seminars, trainin events etc. where printed materials are distributed.

Great page BTW
